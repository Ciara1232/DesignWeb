                    <p>It all started when ______ Father Mike came up with the Alpha idea to start a circus, he trained many talents like magic, gymnastic, he even mastered the art of Tango. He stayed in many Hotels as he Echoed his dream into the wind, many sleepless nights filled with Whiskey.</p> 
                    <br> <p>But after years of training and saving up, he finally started his Circus, Bravo! His Echoes of dreams were answered, and his circus only took from November 1985 November 1986 to set up. He had made a ripple in history Echoing through time. That brings us up to the present time, a magical show that makes you want to dance the Tango, Tango! </p>
